	 * The default content surface for `Dialog`: a fuz_css `.pane` card with a

	 * own layout. It reads `close` from `dialog_context` (set by `Dialog`) and
	 * passes it to `children`, so content can close the dialog without the consumer
	 * threading `close` down from `Dialog`'s own `children` snippet.
	 *
	 * Must be rendered inside a `Dialog`, with which it registers its surface, so
	 * click-outside-to-close treats presses inside the card as inside regardless of
	 * classes -- `pane={false}` works without further setup.
	 *
	 * By default it renders a `close_button` floating just outside the surface's
	 * top-right corner. The surface is a containing block (`position: relative`) for
	 * that button and any absolutely-positioned content in `children`.
	 *
	 * The surface has no layout of its own -- it's a plain block, so children flow
	 * top-to-bottom in normal document order. Pass `class` through (e.g. `box` for a
	 * centered column, `column` for an uncentered one) to add one.

<!-- The surface is centered by `Dialog`'s `.dialog-wrapper` flex (no wrapper of its own
needed) and is a containing block (`position: relative`) for the close button and any
absolutely-positioned content in `children`. `gutter` is the surface's margin -- the
dismiss zone outside the card, where a press lands on the wrapper and closes the dialog.
`min-width: 0` lets this flex-item surface shrink below its content's intrinsic width, so
content with its own overflow (e.g. `Code`) scrolls instead of forcing the card wider. -->
