/**
 * Per-directive sources that allow full interop between fuzdev/sister sites
 * (`*.fuz.dev`, `*.zzz.software`) — loading assets and APIs from each other,
 * and iframing in both directions.
 *
 * Pass into `create_csp_directives({extend: [csp_directives_of_fuzdev]})`.
 * Intended for sites within the ecosystem; external apps usually want a
 * narrower, hand-written allow-list.
 *
 * Deliberately scoped — `script-src`, `style-src`, `worker-src`, etc. are not
 * granted, even between sister sites. Add at the call site if a specific page
 * needs them.
