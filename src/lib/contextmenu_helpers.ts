/**

 * Touch: when the menu opens during a touch (the native longpress `contextmenu` event,
 * or the Safari-compat custom longpress), the release of that same gesture must not
 * interact with the menu - an unprevented `touchend` lets the browser synthesize
 * compatibility mouse events (`mousedown`/`mouseup`/`click`) at the touch point, and the
 * open offsets place the first menu item exactly there, activating it immediately.
 * `touchend` swallows the release to stop the synthesis, and `consume_blocked_click`
 * blocks the next click on the menu as belt and braces (iOS can synthesize the click
 * regardless).
 *
 * Mouse: tap-style input devices (e.g. some touchpads) can register an overlapping
 * primary-button press during the right-click gesture that opened the menu - the
 * compositor serializes the event stream, but the press's hardware `timeStamp` falls
 * inside the gesture, and its delivery can lag long after the menu opened. Because the
 * open offsets place the first menu item under the pointer, that press's `click` would
 * activate the entry. `press_belongs_to_open_gesture` identifies overlap presses
 * exactly: the press's own `buttons` bitmask shows the secondary button still down
 * at generation time, or its `timeStamp` predates the release tracked by
 * `track_mouseup`. No pressed-state is tracked across events deliberately: the native
 * contextmenu's pointer grab swallows the secondary `mouseup` whenever it opens
 * (right-click on our menu, shift+rightclick - which in Firefox doesn't even fire
 * the `contextmenu` event), so a tracked flag wedges stuck, while the judged press's
 * own `buttons` self-corrects. A deliberate right-then-left click - however fast -
 * is sequential in hardware time and is never blocked.
 *
 * Plain DOM-event bookkeeping with no reactive state - used only inside event handlers
 * by `ContextmenuRoot.svelte` and `ContextmenuRootForSafariCompatibility.svelte`.
